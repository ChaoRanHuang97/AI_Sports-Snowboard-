<details>
 <summary>Goal</summary>
The goal in this class is to familiarize you with basic concepts and principles of Artificial Intelligence. This is an introductory course that covers many areas of AI, without going into significant detail in any one. You will learn basic AI techniques, when they are applicable and their limitations.

The course focuses on three major areas of AI –

·       Search

o   Basic (Uninformed) Search (Ch 3)

o   Heuristic (Informed) Search (Ch 3-4)

o   Game Search (Ch 5)

·       Knowledge Representation (Formal Languages and Models),

o   Constraint Satisfaction (Ch 6)

o   Logic (Propositional, First Order) (Ch 7-9)

·       Learning

o   Probabilistic Modelling (Bayesian Networks) (Ch 12-13)

o   Machine Learning (Basics, Linear Regression, kNN, Decision Trees, Neural Nets) (Ch 19, 21)

o   Reinforcement Learning (Ch 22)

We will cover chapters 1-9, 12-13, 19, 21, 22 from the Russell & Norvig textbook.
